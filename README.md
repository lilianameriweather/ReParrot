# ReParrot

ReParrot is a web application that promotes transparency between auto repair organizations and clients by providing detailed information on material and labor costs for various repair services. It enables users to easily search for local auto body shops, compare prices, and make informed decisions about their repairs. 

In this repository you will see how I implemented the ability to add, delete, and edit Auto Services when viewing a list of all current Auto Services -- with the ability to click into each Auto Service for further information such as costs per unit, organization names, unit type used, etc.  

I had the opportunity to handle both Server Side and Client Side. Below you will see a list of actions I took: 


  • Created a functional component, allowing users to view and search auto services via pagination, providing a detailed view based on selected service. 

  • Leveraged user-based permission to allow organizations to manage their auto service content through add/edit forms and delete buttons. 

  • Created the necessary Stored Procedures in SQL utilizing joins and foreign keys. 

  • Built multiple API endpoints with .NET using C# to enable users to read and write to the database as desired and tested with Postman REST client. 

  • Leveraged front-end validation, model binding, and back-end database stored procedures to ensure the integrity of the application data. 

  • Utilized styling with CSS and Bootstrap. 

  • Followed proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code. 

  • Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management. 

  • Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project. 

  • Collaborated with team members on code reviews and merged pull requests using Git and Github to provide and receive feedback for code optimization. 

  • Collaborated with team members using Agile methodology, including daily stand-ups and code reviews.
